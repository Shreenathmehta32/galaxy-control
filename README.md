GalaxyControl : A Futuristic Space Mission Control Dashboard
GalaxyControl is an advanced, interactive, and visually dynamic web application designed to simulate a futuristic space mission control center. Built entirely with core web technologies (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript), it offers an immersive experience reminiscent of real-world space agencies like NASA or SpaceX.
✨ Features
•	Dynamic Home Page: A grand entry point to the mission control, featuring a real-time clock and engaging universe fun facts that update on click.
•	Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
•	Sleek UI/UX: Utilizes a dark space theme with modern glassmorphism effects, glowing panels, and smooth transitions.
•	Orbital Tracking:
o	Simulated live tracking of satellites (ISS, Starlink, Hubble) with animated orbits.
o	Interactive hover effects display real-time (simulated) speed, altitude, and location for each orbiting object.
•	Mars Weather Reports: Displays simulated Martian atmospheric data (temperature, wind speed, dust storms) with periodically updating values.
•	Asteroid Threat Monitoring: Features a scrolling list of simulated asteroid threats with dynamic color-coding (green/yellow/red) and animated trajectory paths.
•	System Console Log: An animated console log providing simulated system messages and operational updates.
•	System Metrics: Radial meters visually represent key system parameters like power, fuel, and data throughput.
•	Live View of Moon: A dedicated section providing simulated moon phase, illumination, and distance data, along with a direct link to an external live planetarium for the Moon.
•	External Resources Integration: Quick access links to official NASA resources, including a featured video: "Cosmic Dawn: The Untold Story of the James Webb Space Telescope."
•	Interactive Chatbot (CelestiaBot): An on-screen AI chatbot powered by the Gemini API, ready to answer your questions about the universe and space.
•	Theme Switcher: Allows toggling between dark and light modes for personalized viewing.
•	Sidebar Navigation: A collapsible sidebar for easy navigation between different dashboard views and access to "About Us" information.
